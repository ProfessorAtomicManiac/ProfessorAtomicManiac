# Hello! :wave: I'm Charles.
This is the home of a bunch of random projects I made. Here's a quick rundown:

## Upcoming/Currently working on
- ðŸ“š Trying to learn Linear Algebra from [MITOpenCourseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video_galleries/video-lectures/). As an interesting way to make sure I know the content I'm making a Linear Algebra library in Python. Think of it as a terrible version of NumPy.
- ðŸ¤– Waiting for January 6th 9:00 AM PST (FRC 2024 Kickoff/Game Reveal)!!
- ðŸ’» Planning to update the [Deep Blue Robotics website](https://github.com/DeepBlueRobotics/DeepBlueRobotics.github.io) once UI/UX components are ready

## Projects
- [Sorting Algorithm Visualizer](https://github.com/ProfessorAtomicManiac/AlgorithmVisualizer) made using PyGame. Its those sorting visualizer videos you find online that make funny noises.
- [Bunch of algorithms + solutions to memorable competitive programming problems](https://github.com/ProfessorAtomicManiac/Code)
- Contributed to Deep Blue Robotics' codebases in [2022](https://github.com/DeepBlueRobotics/RobotCode2022) and [2023](https://github.com/DeepBlueRobotics/RobotCode2023). In 2022, I helped code the intake subsystem. In 2023, I helped code the arm subsystem + autonomous pathing.
- Rewrote some sections on the [robotics training site](https://deep-blue-training.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Todo list Web Application](https://github.com/ProfessorAtomicManiac/to-do-list) made using Svelte. Just me trying out webdev.
- [Webscraping Projects](https://github.com/ProfessorAtomicManiac/Webscraping-Projects) using Beautiful Soup 4, Requests, Selenium, and other Python Webscraping libraries.
- [Really bad recreation of Dream's Speedrunner vs Hunter plugin](https://github.com/ProfessorAtomicManiac/Scuffed-Speedrunner-vs-Hunter)
