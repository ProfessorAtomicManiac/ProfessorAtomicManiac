# Hello! :wave: I'm Charles.
This is the home of a bunch of random projects I made. Here's a quick rundown:

## Upcoming/Currently working on
- ðŸ“š Studying at UW Madison as a computer science major!

## Projects
- (WIP) [Course and Degree Requirements](https://github.com/SDC-Fall-2024/Course-and-Degree-Requirements) made with NextJS. Shows the order of courses that should be taken to fulfill pre-requisites of a course given the courses the student has already taken.
- [Sorting Algorithm Visualizer](https://github.com/ProfessorAtomicManiac/AlgorithmVisualizer) made using PyGame. Imagine the sorting visualizer videos you find online that make funny noises.
- [Bunch of algorithms + solutions to memorable competitive programming problems](https://github.com/ProfessorAtomicManiac/Code)
- Contributed to Deep Blue Robotics' codebases in [2022](https://github.com/DeepBlueRobotics/RobotCode2022), [2023](https://github.com/DeepBlueRobotics/RobotCode2023), and [2024](https://github.com/DeepBlueRobotics/RobotCode2024). In 2022, I helped code the intake subsystem. In 2023, I helped code the arm subsystem + autonomous pathing. Finally in 2024, I helped code the drivetrain subsystem + autonomous pathing. I also wrote some code in [lib199](https://github.com/DeepBlueRobotics/lib199), a custom library made by the team that was used across years.
- Rewrote some sections on the [robotics training site](https://deep-blue-training.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Webscraping Projects](https://github.com/ProfessorAtomicManiac/Webscraping-Projects) using Beautiful Soup 4, Requests, Selenium, and other Python Webscraping libraries.
- [Recreation of Dream's Speedrunner vs Hunter plugin](https://github.com/ProfessorAtomicManiac/Scuffed-Speedrunner-vs-Hunter) made using Java (spigot plugin)
